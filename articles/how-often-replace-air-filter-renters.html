        <h2>How Often Should Renters Replace Air Filters? (And What Happens If You Don’t)</h2>

        <p>
            If you're renting and wondering whether you're supposed to replace the air filter — you're not alone.
            A lot of renters ignore it because they assume it's the landlord’s job.
            Sometimes it is. Sometimes it isn’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's the simple rule:
            <strong>Most renters should replace their air filter every 1–3 months.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>Why It Matters (Even If You Don’t Own the Place)</h3>

        <p>
            Your air filter controls airflow through your HVAC system. When it gets clogged,
            air can’t move properly. That creates problems fast.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your apartment gets hotter or colder than normal</li>
            <li>Your energy bill increases</li>
            <li>The system works harder and can break down</li>
            <li>Dust builds up everywhere</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            And if the HVAC system gets damaged because of a clogged filter?
            That can become your responsibility — especially if your lease says basic upkeep is yours.
        </p>

        <h3>How Often Should You Actually Replace It?</h3>

        <p>
            Here’s the practical breakdown:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Every 1 month</strong> – If you have pets or allergies</li>
            <li><strong>Every 2 months</strong> – Normal apartment use</li>
            <li><strong>Every 3 months</strong> – Light usage, no pets</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you’re not sure — check it once a month. Hold it up to the light.
            If you can’t see through it clearly, replace it.
        </p>

        <h3>Is It Your Responsibility or the Landlord’s?</h3>

        <p>
            This depends on your lease.
            Many leases say renters are responsible for “routine maintenance,”
            which usually includes air filters.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're unsure:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Check your lease under maintenance responsibilities</li>
            <li>Email maintenance and ask directly</li>
            <li>Ask your property manager</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Even if it’s technically their job, replacing a $10 filter is often
            easier than dealing with a broken AC in July.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Replace an Apartment Air Filter (It’s Easier Than You Think)</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Turn off your HVAC system</li>
            <li>Locate the return vent (usually on wall or ceiling)</li>
            <li>Remove the old filter</li>
            <li>Check the size printed on the frame</li>
            <li>Insert the new filter facing the airflow arrow correctly</li>
            <li>Turn system back on</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            That’s it. Five minutes. No tools required in most apartments.
        </p>

        <h3>What Happens If You Don’t Replace It?</h3>

        <p>
            Here’s what actually happens:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Reduced airflow</li>
            <li>Frozen AC coils</li>
            <li>Higher electricity bills</li>
            <li>Possible HVAC damage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Worst case? Maintenance determines neglect caused the issue.
            That’s not a fun conversation during move-out inspection.
        </p>

        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>

        <p>
            Replacing your air filter every 1–3 months is one of the cheapest ways
            to protect your comfort and your deposit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Don’t overthink it. Check it monthly. Replace when dirty.
            It’s simple preventative maintenance.
